Create an interactive educational math game for children with the following specifications:

Game Board:

Create an N×N grid board where N is input by the user (e.g., 5×5, 6×6). N can be any number between 4 and 20.
Each cell should contain a random number between 0 and 100
Numbers should be displayed clearly and be visually appealing for children. All squares should have the same font, background and foreground.


Game Rules:

Starting position: Upper-left corner (0,0)
Goal: Reach the bottom-right corner (N-1, N-1)
Valid moves: Player can move to any adjacent square (up, down, left, right - no diagonals)
Movement constraint: Can only move to squares containing even numbers


User Interface Requirements:

User input: edit box for Board size (4-12),  button for a new game.
Highlight the current position with bright pink. 
the user can keep track of their path so long by the previous locations should be highlighter with light purple.
Display a success message when reaching the goal
Show an error message for invalid moves
Track and display the number of moves taken


Additional Features:

Ensure at least one valid path exists from start to finish

Add a scoring system based on moves taken
Option to reset the game or generate a new board


Educational Elements:

After each move, display whether the chosen number is even/odd
Show simple math facts about the selected number (e.g., '10 is 2×5')
Include positive reinforcement messages



Technical Requirements:

Use clear variable names and comments for maintainability
Implement error handling for invalid inputs
Create modular functions for board generation, move validation, and game state management
Consider adding a simple save/load game feature
