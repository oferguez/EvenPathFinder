[Shira's Numbers Puzzle on GH Pages](https://oferguez.github.io/EvenPathFinder/)

# to do:

* responsive
* ~~choose odds/even/multiples~~
* external config / config screen / personaliosation 
* use of CGPT API:
  - on startup load list of congrats and hamster jokes
  - inline get jokes and congrats
* ~~lint and reformat with proper tool~~
* ~~fix last square issue~~
* ~~use sth better than dfs algo~~
* ~~clear logic, why makemove is checking again if move is legal?~~
* in FireworkExtravaganza - create the Child element internally. no need to push that requirement to the user
* support multi user (few tabs on the browser playing the game, globals seems to collide)
